# PowerBI-Dax-and-M-language
using M language in Power Query for Data Cleansing and Using Dax Functions to Analysis Data in powerBI

***************Questions***************************
Exercise 1:
Write a function in the M language that takes a national ID as input and checks if it is valid or not. If the ID has fewer than 10 digits, it should insert leading zeros as necessary.

Exercise 2:
Design a dashboard similar to the provided dashboard for comparing functions in M, DAX, and Excel. It should only display information related to groups and functions available in the M language.
To accomplish this, you can use your creativity and various visualizations.
Hint: To obtain these functions, you don't need to use external websites as data sources. You should solely rely on Power BI and its internal functions. In other words,
there is a function that lists all available functions within M.

Exercise 3:
Using the GenerateSeries function, create numbers from 1 to 12 and place them inside a slicer. When the user selects any number, display the corresponding clock symbol using the UNICHAR function.

***************Solutions***************************
Exercise 1:
In this Power BI exercise, you are tasked with creating an M language function to validate national identification numbers. Your function should accept a string representing a national ID as input.
It must then check whether the provided ID is valid or not. Additionally, if the ID contains fewer than 10 digits, your function should automatically insert leading zeros to ensure it has a total of 10 digits.

Exercise 2:
This exercise focuses on designing a Power BI dashboard that resembles an existing dashboard but is tailored for comparing functions in the M language, DAX, and Excel.
Your objective is to showcase information related to different function groups and the functions available within the M language.
You are encouraged to employ your creative skills and utilize various visualization elements to present this information effectively.
It's essential to note that you should solely rely on Power BI's internal functions to obtain the list of available functions within the M language, without the need for external data sources.

Exercise 3:
In this Power BI exercise, you will utilize the GenerateSeries function to generate a series of numbers from 1 to 12. 
You will then incorporate these numbers into a slicer within your report. When a user selects a specific number from the slicer,
the task is to display the corresponding clock symbol associated with that number. To accomplish this, you will use the UNICHAR function to convert the number into a character symbol representing a clock face.
This exercise provides a hands-on opportunity to practice using these Power BI functions for interactive data visualization.
